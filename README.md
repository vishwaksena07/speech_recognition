# End-to-End Speech Recognition Pipeline


This project implements a complete end-to-end speech recognition pipeline using signal processing, feature extraction, and acoustic modeling techniques. It demonstrates how raw speech signals can be converted into textual data through various pre-processing and classification steps.

## Features

- *Pre-processing*: Normalization, noise removal, and segmentation.
- *Feature Extraction*: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
- *Modeling*: Classical ML algorithms or deep learning-based acoustic models.
- *Evaluation*: Accuracy and error rate metrics.
